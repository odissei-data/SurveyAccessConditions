# SurveyAccessConditions
This repo is used to store the analysis scripts used to analyse the results of the survey on "Survey on data access conditions for sensitive data" which DANS and ODISSEI held in June and July 2024 using EUSurvey. 

The analysis was performed as part of a submission to the IDCC conference 2024. 
The repo contains two R Scripts, one used for the analysis that was submitted with the abstract of the paper. 
The second one is the script used for the analysis presented in the Full paper. 

The data that these scripts analyse as well as the description of the survey can be found on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12805137
